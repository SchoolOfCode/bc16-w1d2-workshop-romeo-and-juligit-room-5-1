We were given a task a dreadful task...
And it is a pain in my arse
But it is what it is
Do you know what Gandalf is up to these days?
Nah dude, I haven't spoken to him sicne we beat the password out of him 
poor guy,he should have did his job better 
Should have, would have, could have...
Do you know the muffin man?
Nah
...
Listen man, I know you like the muffin man - but we'be got bigger fish to fry. 
We really neeed to watch out for Gandalf's big brother AlphaGo.
He is crazy.
He played Go games with mlti-world champions to the death and never lost.
If Gandalf ever tells Alpha about what we've done to him we are done for!
